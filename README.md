## 📦 Download & Install

1. **Visit the Releases Page:** Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/mahadevphad0607-del/eCommerce/releases) to find the latest version.
   
2. **Choose the Right File:** Download the package suitable for your system. Look for the file with the version number that matches the latest release. 

3. **Extract the Files:** Once downloaded, unzip the file to a folder on your computer.

4. **Set Up the Web Server:**
   - If you use a local server like XAMPP or MAMP, move the unzipped files to the server's root directory (`htdocs` for XAMPP or `Applications/MAMP/htdocs` for MAMP).
   - For a live server, upload the files to your web hosting provider's server using an FTP client.

5. **Create a Database:**
   - Access your MySQL interface (like phpMyAdmin).
   - Create a new database for eCommerce. Remember the name, as you will need it later.

6. **Configure the Application:**
   - Locate the `.env` file in your unzipped folder. 
   - Update the database connection settings to match your database credentials:
     - DB_HOST: usually `localhost`
     - DB_NAME: the name of the database you just created
     - DB_USER: your MySQL username
     - DB_PASSWORD: your MySQL password
 
7. **Run the Installer:**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Type in `http://localhost/eCommerce` (replace `eCommerce` with the folder name if you renamed it).
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

8. **Access Your Store:** After installation, you can visit your store at the same URL. Use the admin credentials you set up during installation to access the dashboard.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you face any issues, consider the following steps:

- **Check PHP Extensions:** Ensure all required PHP extensions are enabled, such as `mysqli`, `curl`, and `mbstring`.
- **File Permissions:** Make sure your web server has access to the eCommerce files.
- **Review Logs:** Check the server logs for error messages that can provide hints.
